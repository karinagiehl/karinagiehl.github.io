I was thinking about what my robot will look like if I continue with the idea of making a cute robot that steals stuff, so I was searching and I found Boxie.

The MIT Media Lab says that: 

"Boxie is a mobile interactive robotic camera built with the goal of actively capturing stories about its environment and the people within it.

Boxie roamed through the MIT Media Lab for a week, to learn about the humans there.

It had a goal of capturing stories about its inhabitants. Inspired by projects such as the tween bot and the afghan explorer, the robot attempted to leverage humans to complete its goals."

Here's a video explaining about the project:

And here is the short version, which kind of resume what Boxie can do:

That said, I would get inspiration from Boxie to make my "Cute Stealer Robot". So I made some guidelines for how should I proceed with the design of my robot:

-My robot should be small, light, cheap, have a cute "face", made with a material that people know, like cardboard or MDF and a nice and soft voice (if it will have one). All of this to acquire the "cuteness factor".
