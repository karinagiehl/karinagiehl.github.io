In the last Tuesday class professor Balogh taught us how to use basic elements of Rhino. 

He also asked us what are our first thoughts of what our architectural robot will be. Then he gave us some considerations about it and showed us some videos of real life examples of robots that have connections with our ideas, to give us some inspiration and a starting point.

I think that mine will be something that tries to trick people into do things just because the robot is cute. I want something that will interact and test people. Something intriguing, that catches people’s attention and make them want to interact with it. I’m thinking about making a robot that asks for a personal belonging and then runs away when they give it to him.

Maybe thinking even more in the architectural aspect, I will make something that plays with something that it’s in Crown Hall, like the water fountain or something else. One possibility is to make an usual object to have a unexpected behavior, in the case of the water fountain, it could have less and less water pressure as the person tries to reach it. Or something like it, I still need to think more about it.

Now it’s time for starting to search for sources and making a plan of how to make it come true.
