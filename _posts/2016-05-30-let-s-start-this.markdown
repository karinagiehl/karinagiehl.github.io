**What is architecture?**

I think that architecture has countless definitions. You can ask thousands of people and probably every one of them will say something different. For me, I would say that I’m still molding my opinion about what architecture is. However, I could define architecture as being something as: the act of thinking about all the aspects of a project, seeking to make the best outcome of the situation. An architect thinks about everything that But I don’t think that architecture is just what the architect does. Look at these animal’s home, for example:

I don’t know if they actually plan their houses, but still, I think that architecture is all over, not just in buildings. It can be in the nature, and why not also in robots?

**What is a robot?**

If you search for “robot” on Google, it will say that it is: *“a machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically, especially one programmable by a computer.”*
Well, that would be the short answer. Robots are not the same as when they first were built, and we are evolving day by day to the point where it is difficult to know what is really a robot and what is not. They are present in our daily lives, even if we don’t see them. But still the image that comes to our mind is the robot shown by the media. Some of them helping humans, other hurting them.
  
So, we could say that a robot is a machine, that is programmed to complete some purpose. Where sometimes they are used to do tasks that are too dangerous for humans or to increase the production of something in a the industry for example.

One thing is certain, we’re just starting, and robots are going to be more and more common through time, and more present in our lives than never.

**How could a robot be architectural?**

Some people say that robots are the future of architecture. But how? Well, robots can complete some tasks easier than humans can (or maybe we just don’t want to complete those tasks), and they can be the key to fabricate different structures that were not possible before, plus with a really good accuracy.  They can be used to reach places where there is not enough space for humans to work, they can be used to discover new cities and even to check problems with the construction. With these robots, we can reach new styles and levels of making architecture. We can change the way that architecture is done.

**How could architecture be robotic?**
We can think about architecture being robotic when we see things like buildings that are programmed to move due some circumstances. Some move with the action of a temperature alert or solar panels, etc.

Within time, our houses can be programmed to be more comfortable for us. Adjusting the temperature, preparing a bath, controlling the lights, everything adjusted to how we want it and ready for when we get home. Maybe, in the future our will be a big robot where we live inside, populated with more robots, helping in different daily tasks. Who knows about the future of architecture and robotics? Maybe we can be part of it.
