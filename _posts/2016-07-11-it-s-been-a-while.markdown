Ok, so I realized that I’m really bad at blogging and being sick haven’t helped at all, it actually made everything really hard, but I need to finish the project anyway. I always have ideas for my posts but then they just get lost between other ideas. So today, after not posting for a while I am finally putting together all my ideas and efforts in these past weeks.

At first I met professor Balogh to talk about the materials that I would need for my prototype. So the list was made of:

- A 3D model of the new wheel
- DRV8825 High Current Stepper Motor Driver Carrier
- Motor
- Photon
-12 Volt Battery
- Some Male/Male Jumper Wires


(FOTO DOS MATERIAIS)


I had the photon, the jumper wires, professor Balogh loaned me the motor and the battery. I bought the motor driver and designed the new wheel.
In the next week, we talked about the design of the wheel, and I spent my time trying to get an accurate -but new- version of the chair’s wheel. It was hard to figure out how to make it with the same measurements but leaving space for the motor. My final design was something like this:

Actually after I printed the 3D parts, I had to redo one of the gears, because I made it in the wrong size, so, for now, the gear is waiting to be printed in the Idea Shop, because the line was kind of long. And I still need to drill some holes in the model and fix the middle, because it is too loose and can make the wheels function in a non-expected way.
For this weekend I’m working on the paper, and organizing what is still missing in my project. I just need to upload all the images in the paper and write the outcomes/conclusion, and I made a list of the next day’s efforts, so I can finish my project. So, in the next days, when the shop opens and I can get my gear, I’m going to put my robot together and test it. I hope it works!
