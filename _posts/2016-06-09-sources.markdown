I was searching for more sources to help me with my robot and I found these two links that may help me with the **codes** that I will need to do the robot's program:

The first one is about a coding that help the robot to **reconize paths**, not hit on objects and this kind of things:

The second ink is about **calculating how far your robot will move**, if you wish to control this. And it's based on the size of the wheels:

Link: <a href="LINK" to the wheel coding>http://www.robotc.net/wikiarchive/Tutorials/Arduino_Projects/Mobile_Robotics/BoeBot/Using_encoders_to_drive_some_distance</a>

Since I want my robot to **"steal"** some of the person's belongings, it needs to move, but only until a **certain distance**. So these will be very useful.

Also, I found these **two sensors** that I can use on the place that the person will put the object on the robot:

Link:<a href="LINK" to the wheel coding> http://www.kr4.us/force-sensitive-resistor-square.html?gclid=CL6JpMmWlc0CFQYuaQodCWsAKg</a>

They are Force Sensitive Resistors, or a FSRs, which are sensors that allow you to detect physical pressure, squeezing and weight. 

So when the robot asks for the **person's belonging**, and the persons places it at the top of that sensor, it will send a message to the robot, saying that there's something in there. Then the robot will move and *"steal"* that thing. But only until a certain distance, so the person can get its things back and not get mad with the robot.
