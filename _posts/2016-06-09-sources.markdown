I found these two links that may help me with the codes for my robot:

LINK to the wheel coding: http://www.robotc.net/wikiarchive/Tutorials/Arduino_Projects/Mobile_Robotics/BoeBot/Using_encoders_to_drive_some_distance

The first one is about coding and basic robotics and the second one is about calculating how far your robot will move, if you wish to control it.

Since I want my robot to "steal" some of the person's belongings, it needs to move, but only until a certain distance. So this will be very useful.

Also, I found these two sensors that I can use on the place that the person will put the object:

They are Force Sensitive Resistors, or a FSRs, which are sensors that allow you to detect physical pressure, squeezing and weight.
